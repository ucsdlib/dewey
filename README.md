A Slack-bot for the UCSD Library

## What can it do?

1. For now, the bot will post to the `#general` channel when a new channel is created.

In time, assuming interest, additional bot-like features will be added, so staff can ask Horton questions like:

1. what are the library hours today?
2. how can I get help learning slack?
3. I need help from the IT Service Desk, how can I contact them?
4. ...
